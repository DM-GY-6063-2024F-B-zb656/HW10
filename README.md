# Sketch 0
For this sketch I used a clip of Hey Bulldog by The Beatles and created a levels visualizer for the different frequency ranges. 


# Sketch 1/2
So I believe I misunderstood the assignment at first and originally made an animated visualization with `getPeaks()`, and then realized that I was supposed to be making a static display, so I started over. I've kept the animated one as sketch 1, and the static display as sketch 2.

For the static display I used three Beatles songs: Hey Bulldog, Lovely Rita, and A Day in the Life. I made displays across the screen with a line representing each sample, with varying color intensities.
